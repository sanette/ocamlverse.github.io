# User Interface

## GUI

* [Revery](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) **WIP**:
A brand-new (and exciting) OCaml/ReasonML-based GUI.
Revery stands as a native, cross-platform alternative to Electron.
* [Brisk](https://github.com/briskml/brisk) **WIP**:
Rather than taking Revery's approach of having a uniform interface,
Brisk aims to use native platform APIs do draw OS-based GUI elements.
* [bogue](https://github.com/sanette/bogue):
A new, SDL-based GUI. Ideal for integration in games. [demo video](https://youtu.be/isFLxnDooL8)
* [lablgtk](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/):
GTK2 bindings for OCaml with various higher-level facilities to define GUIs.
* [lablqml](https://github.com/Kakadu/lablqml):
QML Qt5 bindings for OCaml.
* [labltk](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/labltk/):

* [Lambda-Term](https://github.com/diml/lambda-term):
